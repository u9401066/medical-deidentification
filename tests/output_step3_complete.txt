PHI IDENTIFICATION (RAG + GPT-5-Nano):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are all PHI elements in the document that need masking, with exact text, PHI type, and suggested masking.

1) Exact text: Name: Dr. Emily Chen
   - PHI type: NAME
   - Suggested masking: [PATIENT_NAME_REDACTED]

2) Exact text: Date of Birth: March 15, 1932 (Age: 92 years)
   - PHI type: DATE
   - Suggested masking: Date of Birth: 1932 (Age: 90 or older)

3) Exact text: Medical Record Number: MRN-987654
   - PHI type: MRN
   - Suggested masking: MRN: [REDACTED_MRN]

4) Exact text: Social Security Number: 123-45-6789
   - PHI type: SSN
   - Suggested masking: SSN: [REDACTED_SSN]

5) Exact text: Phone: (555) 234-5678
   - PHI type: PHONE
   - Suggested masking: Phone: [REDACTED_PHONE]

6) Exact text: Email: emily.chen@email.com
   - PHI type: EMAIL
   - Suggested masking: Email: [REDACTED_EMAIL]

7) Exact text: Address: 456 Oak Avenue, Boston, MA 02115
   - PHI type: ADDRESS
   - Suggested masking: Address: [REDACTED_ADDRESS]

8) Exact text: Patient diagnosed with Fabry disease (a rare lysosomal storage disorder) in 2015.
   - PHI type: RARE_DISEASE
   - Suggested masking: Patient diagnosed with [RARE_DISEASE_GENERALIZED] in 2015.

9) Exact text: Last visit: November 20, 2024
   - PHI type: DATE
   - Suggested masking: Last visit: 2024

10) Exact text: Next appointment: December 15, 2024
    - PHI type: DATE
    - Suggested masking: Next appointment: 2024

11) Exact text: Attending Physician: Dr. Michael Johnson
    - PHI type: NAME
    - Suggested masking: Attending Physician: [PATIENT_NAME_REDACTED] (or [PROVIDER_NAME_REDACTED])

12) Exact text: Contact: (555) 876-5432, mjohnson@hospital.org
    - PHI type: (composite) PHONE and EMAIL
    - Suggested masking: Contact: [REDACTED_PHONE], [REDACTED_EMAIL]

Notes and rationale:
- Names of the patient and the attending physician are masked to comply with Safe Harbor-type guidance for patient names and to generalize identifiers.
- The disease Fabry disease is a rare disease; per the instruction, it is generalized to a non-identifying placeholder [RARE_DISEASE_GENERALIZED].
- All direct identifiers (MRN, SSN, phone numbers, and email addresses) are masked.
- Date-related fields are reduced to year-level where appropriate; exact dates are removed or shifted to preserve privacy (e.g., Last visit and Next appointment become just the year).
- The address is removed/masked to [REDACTED_ADDRESS] per the rule to remove street addresses and ZIP codes.
- The composite physician contact line is treated as two PHI types (PHONE and EMAIL) masked accordingly.
