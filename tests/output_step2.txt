HIPAA Safe Harbor requires removal of patient names

GPT-5-Nano Analysis:
PHI identified:
- Phone number: (555) 999-8888
  - Type: Phone number (direct identifier)
  - Why it must be removed: Under HIPAA Safe Harbor, phone numbers are one of the 18 identifiers that must be removed to de-identify PHI. A phone number can directly identify an individual when linked to health information, so it needs to be removed before sharing or publishing.

Note: The text does not include a patient name. If a patient name were present, it would also be PHI and must be removed under Safe Harbor rules.
